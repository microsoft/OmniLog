# Change Log & Release Notes

This document contains a summary of the new features, changes, fixes and known
issues in each release of Trusted Firmware-A.

## 2.6 (2021-11-22)

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- **Architecture**

  - **Activity Monitors Extension (FEAT_AMU)**

    - The public AMU API has been reduced to enablement only
      to facilitate refactoring work. These APIs were not previously used.

      **See:** privatize unused AMU APIs ([b4b726e](https://review.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/b4b726ea868359cf683c07337b69fe91a2a6929a))

    - The `PLAT_AMU_GROUP1_COUNTERS_MASK` platform definition
      has been removed. Platforms should specify per-core AMU counter masks
      via FCONF or a platform-specific mechanism going forward.

      **See:** remove `PLAT_AMU_GROUP1_COUNTERS_MASK` ([6c8dda1](https://review.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/6c8dda19e5f484f8544365fd71d965f0afc39244))

- **Libraries**

  - **FCONF**

    - FCONF is no longer added to BL1 and BL2 automatically
      when the FCONF Makefile (`fconf.mk`) is included. When including this
      Makefile, consider whether you need to add `${FCONF_SOURCES}` and
      `${FCONF_DYN_SOURCES}` to `BL1_SOURCES` and `BL2_SOURCES`.

      **See:** clean up source collection ([e04da4c](https://review.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/e04da4c8e132f43218f18ad3b41479ca54bb9263))

- **Drivers**

  - **Arm**

    - **Ethos-N**

      - multi-device support

        **See:** multi-device support ([1c65989](https://review.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/1c65989e70c9734defc666e824628620b2060b92))

    - Changes the implementation for disabling Secure Cycle Counter. For ARMv8.5
      the counter gets disabled by setting `SDCR.SCCD` bit on CPU cold/warm
      boot. For the earlier architectures PMCR register is saved/restored on
      secure world entry/exit from/to Non-secure state, and cycle counting gets
      disabled by setting PMCR.DP bit.
  - AArch64: Disable Secure Cycle Counter
    - For ARMv8.5 the counter gets disabled by setting `MDCR_El3.SCCD` bit on
      CPU cold/warm boot. For the earlier architectures PMCR_EL0 register is
      saved/restored on secure world entry/exit from/to Non-secure state, and
      cycle counting gets disabled by setting PMCR_EL0.DP bit.

    user guide

    Following the instructions provided in the user guide document does not
    result in the platform entering system suspend state as expected. A message
    relating to the hdlcd driver failing to suspend will be emitted on the Linux
    terminal.

  - mediatek/mt6795: This platform does not build in this release

## 2.1 (2019-03-29)

### New Features

- Architecture

  - Support for ARMv8.3 pointer authentication in the normal and secure worlds

    The use of pointer authentication in the normal world is enabled whenever
    architectural support is available, without the need for additional build
    flags.

    Use of pointer authentication in the secure world remains an experimental
    configuration at this time. Using both the `ENABLE_PAUTH` and
    `CTX_INCLUDE_PAUTH_REGS` build flags, pointer authentication can be enabled
    in EL3 and S-EL1/0.

    See the {ref}`Firmware Design` document for additional details on the use of
    pointer authentication.

  - Enable Data Independent Timing (DIT) in EL3, where supported

- Build System

  - Support for BL-specific build flags

  - Support setting compiler target architecture based on `ARM_ARCH_MINOR` build
    option.

  - New `RECLAIM_INIT_CODE` build flag:

    A significant amount of the code used for the initialization of BL31 is not
    needed again after boot time. In order to reduce the runtime memory
    footprint, the memory used for this code can be reclaimed after
    initialization.

    Certain boot-time functions were marked with the `__init` attribute to
    enable this reclamation.

    default values

  - tzc380: Add TZC-380 TrustZone Controller driver

  - tzc-dmc620: Add driver to manage the TrustZone Controller within the DMC-620
    Dynamic Memory Controller

- Library at ROM (romlib)

  - Add platform-specific jump table list

  - Allow patching of romlib functions

    This change allows patching of functions in the romlib. This can be done by
    adding "patch" at the end of the jump table entry for the function that
    needs to be patched in the file jmptbl.i.

- Library Code

  - Support non-LPAE-enabled MMU tables in AArch32
  - mmio: Add `mmio_clrsetbits_16` function
    - 16-bit variant of `mmio_clrsetbits`

  - arm/juno: Add romlib support

    Building a combined BL1 and ROMLIB binary file with the correct page
    alignment is now supported on the Juno platform. When `USE_ROMLIB` is set
    for Juno, it generates the combined file `bl1_romlib.bin` which needs to be
    used instead of bl1.bin.

  - intel/stratix: Add support for Intel Stratix 10 SoC FPGA platform

  - marvell: Add support for Armada-37xx SoC platform

  - nxp: Add support for i.MX8M and i.MX7 Warp7 platforms

  - renesas: Add support for R-Car Gen3 platform

  - xilinx: Add support for Versal ACAP platforms

- Position-Independent Executable (PIE)

  PIE support has initially been added to BL31. The `ENABLE_PIE` build flag is
  used to enable or disable this functionality as required.

- Secure Partition Manager

  - New SPM implementation based on SPCI Alpha 1 draft specification

    A new version of SPM has been implemented, based on the SPCI (Secure
    Partition Client Interface) and SPRT (Secure Partition Runtime) draft
    specifications.

    The new implementation is a prototype that is expected to undergo intensive
    rework as the specifications change. It has basic support for multiple
    Secure Partitions and Resource Descriptions.

    The older version of SPM, based on MM (ARM Management Mode Interface
    Specification), is still present in the codebase. A new build flag, `SPM_MM`
    has been added to allow selection of the desired implementation. This flag
    defaults to 1, selecting the MM-based implementation.

- Security

  - Spectre Variant-1 mitigations (`CVE-2017-5753`)

  - Use Speculation Store Bypass Safe (SSBS) functionality where available

    Provides mitigation against `CVE-2018-19440` (Not saving x0 to x3 registers
    can leak information from one Normal World SMC client to another)

### Changed

- Build System

  - Warning levels are now selectable with `W=<1,2,3>`
  - Removed unneeded include paths in PLAT_INCLUDES
  - "Warnings as errors" (Werror) can be disabled using `E=0`
  - Support totally quiet output with `-s` flag
  - Support passing options to checkpatch using `CHECKPATCH_OPTS=<opts>`
  - Invoke host compiler with `HOSTCC / HOSTCCFLAGS` instead of `CC / CFLAGS`
  - Make device tree pre-processing similar to U-boot/Linux by:
    - Creating separate `CPPFLAGS` for DT preprocessing so that compiler options
      specific to it can be accommodated.
    - Replacing `CPP` with `PP` for DT pre-processing

- CPU Support

  - Errata report function definition is now mandatory for CPU support files

    CPU operation files must now define a `<name>_errata_report` function to
    print errata status. This is no longer a weak reference.

- Documentation

  - Migrated some content from GitHub wiki to `docs/` directory
  - Security advisories now have CVE links
  - Updated copyright guidelines

- Drivers

  - console: The `MULTI_CONSOLE_API` framework has been rewritten in C

  - console: Ported multi-console driver to AArch32

  - gic: Remove 'lowest priority' constants

    Removed `GIC_LOWEST_SEC_PRIORITY` and `GIC_LOWEST_NS_PRIORITY`. Platforms
    should define these if required, or instead determine the correct priority
    values at runtime.

  - delay_timer: Check that the Generic Timer extension is present

  - mmc: Increase command reply timeout to 10 milliseconds

  - mmc: Poll eMMC device status to ensure `EXT_CSD` command completion

  - mmc: Correctly check return code from `mmc_fill_device_info`

- External Libraries

  - libfdt: Upgraded from 1.4.2 to 1.4.6-9

  >

  - mbed TLS: Upgraded from 2.12 to 2.16

  >

  This change incorporates fixes for security issues that should be reviewed to
  determine if they are relevant for software implementations using Trusted
  Firmware-A. See the [mbed TLS releases] page for details on changes from the
  2.12 to the 2.16 release.

- Library Code

  - compiler-rt: Updated `lshrdi3.c` and `int_lib.h` with changes from LLVM
    master branch (r345645)
  - cpu: Updated macro that checks need for `CVE-2017-5715` mitigation
  - libc: Made setjmp and longjmp C standard compliant
  - libc: Allowed overriding the default libc (use `OVERRIDE_LIBC`)
  - libc: Moved setjmp and longjmp to the `libc/` directory

- Platforms

  - Removed Mbed TLS dependency from plat_bl_common.c

  - arm: Removed unused `ARM_MAP_BL_ROMLIB` macro

  - arm: Removed `ARM_BOARD_OPTIMISE_MEM` feature and build flag

  - arm: Moved several components into `drivers/` directory

    This affects the SDS, SCP, SCPI, MHU and SCMI components

  - arm/juno: Increased maximum BL2 image size to `0xF000`

    This change was required to accommodate a larger `libfdt` library

- SCMI

  - Optimized bakery locks when hardware-assisted coherency is enabled using the
    `HW_ASSISTED_COHERENCY` build flag

- SDEI

  - Added support for unconditionally resuming secure world execution after {{
    SDEI }} event processing completes

    {{ SDEI }} interrupts, although targeting EL3, occur on behalf of the
    non-secure world, and may have higher priority than secure world interrupts.
    Therefore they might preempt secure execution and yield execution to the
    non-secure {{ SDEI }} handler. Upon completion of {{ SDEI }} event handling,
    resume secure execution if it was preempted.

- Translation Tables (XLAT)

  - Dynamically detect need for `Common not Private (TTBRn_ELx.CnP)` bit

    Properly handle the case where `ARMv8.2-TTCNP` is implemented in a CPU that
    does not implement all mandatory v8.2 features (and so must claim to
    implement a lower architecture version).

### Resolved Issues

- Architecture
  - Incorrect check for SSBS feature detection
  - Unintentional register clobber in AArch32 reset_handler function
- Build System
  - Dependency issue during DTB image build
  - Incorrect variable expansion in Arm platform makefiles
  - Building on Windows with verbose mode (`V=1`) enabled is broken
  - AArch32 compilation flags is missing `$(march32-directive)`
- BL-Specific Issues
  - bl2: `uintptr_t is not defined` error when `BL2_IN_XIP_MEM` is defined
  - bl2: Missing prototype warning in `bl2_arch_setup`
  - bl31: Omission of Global Offset Table (GOT) section
- Code Quality Issues
  - Multiple MISRA compliance issues
  - Potential NULL pointer dereference (Coverity-detected)
- Drivers
  - mmc: Local declaration of `scr` variable causes a cache issue when
    invalidating after the read DMA transfer completes
  - mmc: `ACMD41` does not send voltage information during initialization,
    resulting in the command being treated as a query. This prevents the command
    from initializing the controller.
  - mmc: When checking device state using `mmc_device_state()` there are no
    retries attempted in the event of an error
  - ccn: Incorrect Region ID calculation for RN-I nodes
  - console: `Fix MULTI_CONSOLE_API` when used as a crash console
  - partition: Improper NULL checking in gpt.c
  - partition: Compilation failure in `VERBOSE` mode (`V=1`)
- Library Code
  - common: Incorrect check for Address Authentication support

  - xlat: Fix XLAT_V1 / XLAT_V2 incompatibility

    The file `arm_xlat_tables.h` has been renamed to `xlat_tables_compat.h` and
    has been moved to a common folder. This header can be used to guarantee
    compatibility, as it includes the correct header based on
    `XLAT_TABLES_LIB_V2`.

  - xlat: armclang unused-function warning on `xlat_clean_dcache_range`

  - xlat: Invalid `mm_cursor` checks in `mmap_add` and `mmap_add_ctx`

  - sdei: Missing `context.h` header
- Platforms
  - common: Missing prototype warning for `plat_log_get_prefix`

  - arm: Insufficient maximum BL33 image size

  - arm: Potential memory corruption during BL2-BL31 transition

    On Arm platforms, the BL2 memory can be overlaid by BL31/BL32. The memory
    descriptors describing the list of executable images are created in BL2 R/W
    memory, which could be possibly corrupted later on by BL31/BL32 due to
    overlay. This patch creates a reserved location in SRAM for these
    descriptors and are copied over by BL2 before handing over to next BL image.

  - juno: Invalid behaviour when `CSS_USE_SCMI_SDS_DRIVER` is not set

    In `juno_pm.c` the `css_scmi_override_pm_ops` function was used regardless
    of whether the build flag was set. The original behaviour has been restored
    in the case where the build flag is not set.
- Tools
  - fiptool: Incorrect UUID parsing of blob parameters
  - doimage: Incorrect object rules in Makefile

### Deprecations

- Common Code
  - `plat_crash_console_init` function
  - `plat_crash_console_putc` function
  - `plat_crash_console_flush` function
  - `finish_console_register` macro

  - helpers: `get_afflvl_shift`
  - helpers: `mpidr_mask_lower_afflvls`
  - helpers: `eret`
- Secure Partition Manager (SPM)
  - Boot-info structure

### Known Issues

- Build System Issues
  - dtb: DTB creation not supported when building on a Windows host.

    This step in the build process is skipped when running on a Windows host. A
    known issue from the 1.6 release.
- Platform Issues
  - arm/juno: System suspend from Linux does not function as documented in the
    user guide

    Following the instructions provided in the user guide document does not
    result in the platform entering system suspend state as expected. A message
    relating to the hdlcd driver failing to suspend will be emitted on the Linux
    terminal.

  - arm/juno: The firmware update use-cases do not work with motherboard
    firmware version \< v1.5.0 (the reset reason is not preserved). The Linaro
    18.04 release has MB v1.4.9. The MB v1.5.0 is available in Linaro 18.10
    release.

  - mediatek/mt6795: This platform does not build in this release

## 2.0 (2018-10-02)

### New Features

  - A new Platform Compatibility Policy document has been created which
    references a wiki page that maintains a listing of deprecated interfaces and
    the release after which they will be removed.
  - All deprecated interfaces except the MULTI_CONSOLE_API have been removed
    from the code base.
  - Various Arm and partner platforms have been updated to remove the use of
    removed APIs in this release.
  - This release is otherwise unchanged from 1.6 release

### Issues resolved since last release

- No issues known at 1.6 release resolved in 2.0 release

### Known Issues

- DTB creation not supported when building on a Windows host. This step in the
  build process is skipped when running on a Windows host. Known issue from 1.6
  version.
- As a result of removal of deprecated interfaces the Nvidia Tegra, Marvell
  Armada 8K and MediaTek MT6795 platforms do not build in this release. Also
  MediaTek MT8173, NXP QorIQ LS1043A, NXP i.MX8QX, NXP i.MX8QMa, Rockchip
  RK3328, Rockchip RK3368 and Rockchip RK3399 platforms have not been confirmed
  to be working after the removal of the deprecated interfaces although they do
  build.

## 1.6 (2018-09-21)

### New Features

- Addressing Speculation Security Vulnerabilities

  - Implement static workaround for CVE-2018-3639 for AArch32 and AArch64
  - Add support for dynamic mitigation for CVE-2018-3639
  - Implement dynamic mitigation for CVE-2018-3639 on Cortex-A76
  - Ensure {{ SDEI }} handler executes with CVE-2018-3639 mitigation enabled

- Introduce RAS handling on AArch64

  - Some RAS extensions are mandatory for Armv8.2 CPUs, with others mandatory
    for Armv8.4 CPUs however, all extensions are also optional extensions to the
    base Armv8.0 architecture.
  - The Armv8 RAS Extensions introduced Standard Error Records which are a set
    of standard registers to configure RAS node policy and allow RAS Nodes to
    record and expose error information for error handling agents.
  - Capabilities are provided to support RAS Node enumeration and iteration
    along with individual interrupt registrations and fault injections support.
  - Introduce handlers for Uncontainable errors, Double Faults and EL3 External
    Aborts

- Enable Memory Partitioning And Monitoring (MPAM) for lower EL's

  - Memory Partitioning And Monitoring is an Armv8.4 feature that enables
    various memory system components and resources to define partitions.
    Software running at various ELs can then assign themselves to the desired
    partition to control their performance aspects.
  - When ENABLE_MPAM_FOR_LOWER_ELS is set to 1, EL3 allows lower ELs to access
    their own MPAM registers without trapping to EL3. This patch however,
    doesn't make use of partitioning in EL3; platform initialisation code should
    configure and use partitions in EL3 if required.

- Introduce ROM Lib Feature

  - Support combining several libraries into a self-called "romlib" image, that
    may be shared across images to reduce memory footprint. The romlib image is
    stored in ROM but is accessed through a jump-table that may be stored in
    read-write memory, allowing for the library code to be patched.

- Introduce Backtrace Feature

  - This function displays the backtrace, the current EL and security state to
    allow a post-processing tool to choose the right binary to interpret the
    dump.
  - Print backtrace in assert() and panic() to the console.

- Code hygiene changes and alignment with MISRA C-2012 guideline with fixes
  addressing issues complying to the following rules:

  - MISRA rules 4.9, 5.1, 5.3, 5.7, 8.2-8.5, 8.8, 8.13, 9.3, 10.1, 10.3-10.4,
    10.8, 11.3, 11.6, 12.1, 14.4, 15.7, 16.1-16.7, 17.7-17.8, 20.7, 20.10,
    20.12, 21.1, 21.15, 22.7
  - Clean up the usage of void pointers to access symbols
  - Increase usage of static qualifier to locally used functions and data
  - Migrated to use of u_register_t for register read/write to better match
    AArch32 and AArch64 type sizes
  - Use int-ll64 for both AArch32 and AArch64 to assist in consistent format
    strings between architectures
  - Clean up TF-A libc by removing non arm copyrighted implementations and
    replacing them with modified FreeBSD and SCC implementations

- Various changes to support Clang linker and assembler

  - The clang assembler/preprocessor is used when Clang is selected. However,
    the clang linker is not used because it is unable to link TF-A objects due
    to immaturity of clang linker functionality at this time.

- Refactor support APIs into Libraries

  - Evolve libfdt, mbed TLS library and standard C library sources as proper
    libraries that TF-A may be linked against.

- CPU Enhancements

  - Add CPU support for Cortex-Ares and Cortex-A76
  - Add AMU support for Cortex-Ares
  - Add initial CPU support for Cortex-Deimos
  - Add initial CPU support for Cortex-Helios
  - Implement dynamic mitigation for CVE-2018-3639 on Cortex-A76
  - Implement Cortex-Ares erratum 1043202 workaround
  - Implement DSU erratum 936184 workaround
  - Check presence of fix for errata 843419 in Cortex-A53
  - Check presence of fix for errata 835769 in Cortex-A53

- Translation Tables Enhancements

  - The xlat v2 library has been refactored in order to be reused by different
    TF components at different EL's including the addition of EL2. Some
    refactoring to make the code more generic and less specific to TF, in order
    to reuse the library outside of this project.

- SPM Enhancements

  - General cleanups and refactoring to pave the way to multiple partitions
    support

- SDEI Enhancements

  - Allow platforms to define explicit events
  - Determine client EL from NS context's SCR_EL3
  - Make dispatches synchronous
  - Introduce jump primitives for BL31
  - Mask events after CPU wakeup in {{ SDEI }} dispatcher to conform to the
    specification

- Misc TF-A Core Common Code Enhancements

  - Add support for eXecute In Place (XIP) memory in BL2
  - Add support for the SMC Calling Convention 2.0
  - Introduce External Abort handling on AArch64 External Abort routed to EL3
    was reported as an unhandled exception and caused a panic. This change
    enables Trusted Firmware-A to handle External Aborts routed to EL3.
  - Save value of ACTLR_EL1 implementation-defined register in the CPU context
    structure rather than forcing it to 0.
  - Introduce ARM_LINUX_KERNEL_AS_BL33 build option, which allows BL31 to
    directly jump to a Linux kernel. This makes for a quicker and simpler boot
    flow, which might be useful in some test environments.
  - Add dynamic configurations for BL31, BL32 and BL33 enabling support for
    Chain of Trust (COT).
  - Make TF UUID RFC 4122 compliant

  - Provide RAS support
  - Migrate AArch64 port to the multi console driver. The old API is deprecated
    and will eventually be removed.
  - Move BL31 below BL2 to enable BL2 overlay resulting in changes in the layout
    of BL images in memory to enable more efficient use of available space.
  - Add cpp build processing for dtb that allows processing device tree with
    external includes.
  - Extend FIP io driver to support multiple FIP devices

### Issues resolved since last release

- No issues known at 1.5 release resolved in 1.6 release

### Known Issues

- DTB creation not supported when building on a Windows host. This step in the
  build process is skipped when running on a Windows host. Known issue from 1.5
  version.

## 1.5 (2018-03-20)

### New features

- Added new firmware support to enable RAS (Reliability, Availability, and
  Serviceability) functionality.

  - Secure Partition Manager (SPM): A Secure Partition is a software execution
    environment instantiated in S-EL0 that can be used to implement simple
    management and security services. The SPM is the firmware component that is
    responsible for managing a Secure Partition.

  - SDEI dispatcher: Support for interrupt-based {{ SDEI }} events and all
    interfaces as defined by the {{ SDEI }} specification v1.0, see
    [SDEI Specification]

  - Exception Handling Framework (EHF): Framework that allows dispatching of EL3
    interrupts to their registered handlers which are registered based on their
    priorities. Facilitates firmware-first error handling policy where
    asynchronous exceptions may be routed to EL3.

    Integrated the TSPD with EHF.

- Updated PSCI support:

  - Implemented PSCI v1.1 optional features `MEM_PROTECT` and `SYSTEM_RESET2`.
    The supported PSCI version was updated to v1.1.

  - Improved PSCI STAT timestamp collection, including moving accounting for
    retention states to be inside the locks and fixing handling of wrap-around
    when calculating residency in AArch32 execution state.

  - Added optional handler for early suspend that executes when suspending to a
    power-down state and with data caches enabled.

    This may provide a performance improvement on platforms where it is safe to
    perform some or all of the platform actions from `pwr_domain_suspend` with
    the data caches enabled.

- Enabled build option, BL2_AT_EL3, for BL2 to allow execution at EL3 without
  any dependency on TF BL1.

  This allows platforms which already have a non-TF Boot ROM to directly load
  and execute BL2 and subsequent BL stages without need for BL1. This was not
  previously possible because BL2 executes at S-EL1 and cannot jump straight to
  EL3.

- Implemented support for SMCCC v1.1, including `SMCCC_VERSION` and
  `SMCCC_ARCH_FEATURES`.

  Additionally, added support for `SMCCC_VERSION` in PSCI features to enable
  discovery of the SMCCC version via PSCI feature call.

- Added Dynamic Configuration framework which enables each of the boot loader
  stages to be dynamically configured at runtime if required by the platform.
  The boot loader stage may optionally specify a firmware configuration file
  and/or hardware configuration file that can then be shared with the next boot
  loader stage.

  Introduced a new BL handover interface that essentially allows passing of 4
  arguments between the different BL stages.

  Updated cert_create and fip_tool to support the dynamic configuration files.
  The COT also updated to support these new files.

- Code hygiene changes and alignment with MISRA guideline:

  - Fix use of undefined macros.
  - Achieved compliance with Mandatory MISRA coding rules.
  - Achieved compliance for following Required MISRA rules for the default build
    configurations on FVP and Juno platforms : 7.3, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.8.

- Added support for Armv8.2-A architectural features:

  - Updated translation table set-up to set the CnP (Common not Private) bit for
    secure page tables so that multiple PEs in the same Inner Shareable domain
    can use the same translation table entries for a given stage of translation
    in a particular translation regime.
  - Extended the supported values of ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1.PARange to include the
    52-bit Physical Address range.
  - Added support for the Scalable Vector Extension to allow Normal world
    software to access SVE functionality but disable access to SVE, SIMD and
    floating point functionality from the Secure world in order to prevent
    corruption of the Z-registers.

- Added support for Armv8.4-A architectural feature Activity Monitor Unit (AMU)

  extensions.

  In addition to the v8.4 architectural extension, AMU support on Cortex-A75 was
  implemented.

- Enhanced OP-TEE support to enable use of pageable OP-TEE image. The Arm
  standard platforms are updated to load up to 3 images for OP-TEE; header,
  pager image and paged image.

  The chain of trust is extended to support the additional images.

- Enhancements to the translation table library:

  - Introduced APIs to get and set the memory attributes of a region.
  - Added support to manage both privilege levels in translation regimes that
    describe translations for 2 Exception levels, specifically the EL1&0
    translation regime, and extended the memory map region attributes to include
    specifying Non-privileged access.
  - Added support to specify the granularity of the mappings of each region, for
    instance a 2MB region can be specified to be mapped with 4KB page tables
    instead of a 2MB block.
  - Disabled the higher VA range to avoid unpredictable behaviour if there is an
    attempt to access addresses in the higher VA range.
  - Added helpers for Device and Normal memory MAIR encodings that align with
    the Arm Architecture Reference Manual for Armv8-A (Arm DDI0487B.b).
  - Code hygiene including fixing type length and signedness of constants,
    refactoring of function to enable the MMU, removing all instances where the
    virtual address space is hardcoded and added comments that document
    alignment needed between memory attributes and attributes specified in
    TCR_ELx.

- Updated GIC support:

  - Introduce new APIs for GICv2 and GICv3 that provide the capability to
    specify interrupt properties rather than list of interrupt numbers alone.
    The Arm platforms and other upstream platforms are migrated to use interrupt
    properties.

  - Added helpers to save / restore the GICv3 context, specifically the
    Distributor and Redistributor contexts and architectural parts of the ITS
    power management. The Distributor and Redistributor helpers also support the
    implementation-defined part of GIC-500 and GIC-600.

    Updated the Arm FVP platform to save / restore the GICv3 context on system
    suspend / resume as an example of how to use the helpers.

    Introduced a new TZC secured DDR carve-out for use by Arm platforms for
    storing EL3 runtime data such as the GICv3 register context.

- Added support for Armv7-A architecture via build option ARM_ARCH_MAJOR=7. This
  includes following features:

  - Updates GICv2 driver to manage GICv1 with security extensions.
  - Software implementation for 32bit division.
  - Enabled use of generic timer for platforms that do not set
    ARM_CORTEX_Ax=yes.
  - Support for Armv7-A Virtualization extensions \[DDI0406C_C\].
  - Support for both Armv7-A platforms that only have 32-bit addressing and
    Armv7-A platforms that support large page addressing.
  - Included support for following Armv7 CPUs: Cortex-A12, Cortex-A17,
    Cortex-A7, Cortex-A5, Cortex-A9, Cortex-A15.
  - Added support in QEMU for Armv7-A/Cortex-A15.

- Enhancements to Firmware Update feature:

  - Updated the FWU documentation to describe the additional images needed for
    Firmware update, and how they are used for both the Juno platform and the
    Arm FVP platforms.

- Enhancements to Trusted Board Boot feature:

  - Added support to cert_create tool for RSA PKCS1# v1.5 and SHA384, SHA512 and
    SHA256.
  - For Arm platforms added support to use ECDSA keys.
  - Enhanced the mbed TLS wrapper layer to include support for both RSA and
    ECDSA to enable runtime selection between RSA and ECDSA keys.

- Added support for secure interrupt handling in AArch32 sp_min, hardcoded to
  only handle FIQs.

- Added support to allow a platform to load images from multiple boot sources,
  for example from a second flash drive.

- Added a logging framework that allows platforms to reduce the logging level at
  runtime and additionally the prefix string can be defined by the platform.

- Further improvements to register initialisation:

  - Control register PMCR_EL0 / PMCR is set to prohibit cycle counting in the
    secure world. This register is added to the list of registers that are saved
    and restored during world switch.
  - When EL3 is running in AArch32 execution state, the Non-secure version of
    SCTLR is explicitly initialised during the warmboot flow rather than relying
    on the hardware to set the correct reset values.

- Enhanced support for Arm platforms:

  - Introduced driver for Shared-Data-Structure (SDS) framework which is used
    for communication between SCP and the AP CPU, replacing Boot-Over_MHU (BOM)
    protocol.

    The Juno platform is migrated to use SDS with the SCMI support added in v1.3
    and is set as default.

    The driver can be found in the plat/arm/css/drivers folder.

  - Improved memory usage by only mapping TSP memory region when the TSPD has
    been included in the build. This reduces the memory footprint and avoids
    unnecessary memory being mapped.

  - Updated support for multi-threading CPUs for FVP platforms - always check
    the MT field in MPDIR and access the bit fields accordingly.

  - Support building for platforms that model DynamIQ configuration by
    implementing all CPUs in a single cluster.

  - Improved nor flash driver, for instance clearing status registers before
    sending commands. Driver can be found plat/arm/board/common folder.

- Enhancements to QEMU platform:

  - Added support for TBB.
  - Added support for using OP-TEE pageable image.
  - Added support for LOAD_IMAGE_V2.
  - Migrated to use translation table library v2 by default.
  - Added support for SEPARATE_CODE_AND_RODATA.

- Applied workarounds CVE-2017-5715 on Arm Cortex-A57, -A72, -A73 and -A75, and
  for Armv7-A CPUs Cortex-A9, -A15 and -A17.

- Applied errata workaround for Arm Cortex-A57: 859972.

- Applied errata workaround for Arm Cortex-A72: 859971.

- Added support for Poplar 96Board platform.

- Added support for Raspberry Pi 3 platform.

- Added Call Frame Information (CFI) assembler directives to the vector entries
  which enables debuggers to display the backtrace of functions that triggered a
  synchronous abort.

- Added ability to build dtb.

- Added support for pre-tool (cert_create and fiptool) image processing enabling
  compression of the image files before processing by cert_create and fiptool.

  This can reduce fip size and may also speed up loading of images. The image
  verification will also get faster because certificates are generated based on
  compressed images.

  Imported zlib 1.2.11 to implement gunzip() for data compression.

- Enhancements to fiptool:

  - Enabled the fiptool to be built using Visual Studio.
  - Added padding bytes at the end of the last image in the fip to be facilitate
    transfer by DMA.

### Issues resolved since last release

- TF-A can be built with optimisations disabled (-O0).
- Memory layout updated to enable Trusted Board Boot on Juno platform when
  running TF-A in AArch32 execution mode (resolving [tf-issue#501]).

### Known Issues

- DTB creation not supported when building on a Windows host. This step in the
  build process is skipped when running on a Windows host.

## 1.4 (2017-07-07)

### New features

- Enabled support for platforms with hardware assisted coherency.

  A new build option HW_ASSISTED_COHERENCY allows platforms to take advantage of
  the following optimisations:

  - Skip performing cache maintenance during power-up and power-down.
  - Use spin-locks instead of bakery locks.
  - Enable data caches early on warm-booted CPUs.

- Added support for Cortex-A75 and Cortex-A55 processors.

  Both Cortex-A75 and Cortex-A55 processors use the Arm DynamIQ Shared Unit
  (DSU). The power-down and power-up sequences are therefore mostly managed in
  hardware, reducing complexity of the software operations.

- Introduced Arm GIC-600 driver.

  Arm GIC-600 IP complies with Arm GICv3 architecture. For FVP platforms, the
  GIC-600 driver is chosen when FVP_USE_GIC_DRIVER is set to FVP_GIC600.

- Updated GICv3 support:

  - Introduced power management APIs for GICv3 Redistributor. These APIs allow
    platforms to power down the Redistributor during CPU power on/off. Requires
    the GICv3 implementations to have power management operations.

    Implemented the power management APIs for FVP.

  - GIC driver data is flushed by the primary CPU so that secondary CPU do not
    read stale GIC data.

- Added support for Arm System Control and Management Interface v1.0 (SCMI).

  The SCMI driver implements the power domain management and system power
  management protocol of the SCMI specification (Arm DEN 0056ASCMI) for
  communicating with any compliant power controller.

  Support is added for the Juno platform. The driver can be found in the
  plat/arm/css/drivers folder.

- Added support to enable pre-integration of TBB with the Arm TrustZone
  CryptoCell product, to take advantage of its hardware Root of Trust and crypto
  acceleration services.

- Enabled Statistical Profiling Extensions for lower ELs.

  The firmware support is limited to the use of SPE in the Non-secure state and
  accesses to the SPE specific registers from S-EL1 will trap to EL3.

  The SPE are architecturally specified for AArch64 only.

- Code hygiene changes aligned with MISRA guidelines:

  - Fixed signed / unsigned comparison warnings in the translation table
    library.
  - Added U(\_x) macro and together with the existing ULL(\_x) macro fixed some
    of the signed-ness defects flagged by the MISRA scanner.

- Enhancements to Firmware Update feature:

  - The FWU logic now checks for overlapping images to prevent execution of
    unauthenticated arbitrary code.
  - Introduced new FWU_SMC_IMAGE_RESET SMC that changes the image loading state
    machine to go from COPYING, COPIED or AUTHENTICATED states to RESET state.
    Previously, this was only possible when the authentication of an image
    failed or when the execution of the image finished.
  - Fixed integer overflow which addressed TFV-1: Malformed Firmware Update SMC
    can result in copy of unexpectedly large data into secure memory.

- Introduced support for Arm Compiler 6 and LLVM (clang).

  TF-A can now also be built with the Arm Compiler 6 or the clang compilers. The
  assembler and linker must be provided by the GNU toolchain.

  Tested with Arm CC 6.7 and clang 3.9.x and 4.0.x.

- Memory footprint improvements:

  - Introduced `tf_snprintf`, a reduced version of `snprintf` which has support
    for a limited set of formats.

    The mbedtls driver is updated to optionally use `tf_snprintf` instead of
    `snprintf`.

  - The `assert()` is updated to no longer print the function name, and
    additional logging options are supported via an optional platform define
    `PLAT_LOG_LEVEL_ASSERT`, which controls how verbose the assert output is.

- Enhancements to TF-A support when running in AArch32 execution state:

  - Support booting SP_MIN and BL33 in AArch32 execution mode on Juno. Due to
    hardware limitations, BL1 and BL2 boot in AArch64 state and there is
    additional trampoline code to warm reset into SP_MIN in AArch32 execution
    state.
  - Added support for Arm Cortex-A53/57/72 MPCore processors including the
    errata workarounds that are already implemented for AArch64 execution state.
  - For FVP platforms, added AArch32 Trusted Board Boot support, including the
    Firmware Update feature.

- Introduced Arm SiP service for use by Arm standard platforms.

  - Added new Arm SiP Service SMCs to enable the Non-secure world to read PMF
    timestamps.

    Added PMF instrumentation points in TF-A in order to quantify the overall
    time spent in the PSCI software implementation.

  - Added new Arm SiP service SMC to switch execution state.

    This allows the lower exception level to change its execution state from
    AArch64 to AArch32, or vice verse, via a request to EL3.

- Migrated to use SPDX\[0\] license identifiers to make software license
  auditing simpler.

  \:::\{note} Files that have been imported by FreeBSD have not been modified.

  \[0\]: <https://spdx.org/>

- Enhancements to the translation table library:

  - Added version 2 of translation table library that allows different
    translation tables to be modified by using different 'contexts'. Version 1
    of the translation table library only allows the current EL's translation
    tables to be modified.

    Version 2 of the translation table also added support for dynamic regions;
    regions that can be added and removed dynamically whilst the MMU is enabled.
    Static regions can only be added or removed before the MMU is enabled.

    The dynamic mapping functionality is enabled or disabled when compiling by
    setting the build option PLAT_XLAT_TABLES_DYNAMIC to 1 or 0. This can be
    done per-image.

  - Added support for translation regimes with two virtual address spaces such
    as the one shared by EL1 and EL0.

    The library does not support initializing translation tables for EL0
    software.

  - Added support to mark the translation tables as non-cacheable using an
    additional build option `XLAT_TABLE_NC`.

- Added support for GCC stack protection. A new build option
  ENABLE_STACK_PROTECTOR was introduced that enables compilation of all BL
  images with one of the GCC -fstack-protector-\* options.

  A new platform function plat_get_stack_protector_canary() was introduced that
  returns a value used to initialize the canary for stack corruption detection.
  For increased effectiveness of protection platforms must provide an
  implementation that returns a random value.

- Enhanced support for Arm platforms:

  - Added support for multi-threading CPUs, indicated by `MT` field in MPDIR. A
    new build flag `ARM_PLAT_MT` is added, and when enabled, the functions
    accessing MPIDR assume that the `MT` bit is set for the platform and access
    the bit fields accordingly.

    Also, a new API `plat_arm_get_cpu_pe_count` is added when `ARM_PLAT_MT` is
    enabled, returning the Processing Element count within the physical CPU
    corresponding to `mpidr`.

  - The Arm platforms migrated to use version 2 of the translation tables.

  - Introduced a new Arm platform layer API `plat_arm_psci_override_pm_ops`
    which allows Arm platforms to modify `plat_arm_psci_pm_ops` and therefore
    dynamically define PSCI capability.

  - The Arm platforms migrated to use IMAGE_LOAD_V2 by default.

- Enhanced reporting of errata workaround status with the following policy:

  - If an errata workaround is enabled:

    - If it applies (i.e. the CPU is affected by the errata), an INFO message is
      printed, confirming that the errata workaround has been applied.
    - If it does not apply, a VERBOSE message is printed, confirming that the
      errata workaround has been skipped.

  - If an errata workaround is not enabled, but would have applied had it been,
    a WARN message is printed, alerting that errata workaround is missing.

- Added build options ARM_ARCH_MAJOR and ARM_ARM_MINOR to choose the
  architecture version to target TF-A.

- Updated the spin lock implementation to use the more efficient CAS (Compare
  And Swap) instruction when available. This instruction was introduced in
  Armv8.1-A.

- Applied errata workaround for Arm Cortex-A53: 855873.

- Applied errata workaround for Arm-Cortex-A57: 813419.

- Enabled all A53 and A57 errata workarounds for Juno, both in AArch64 and
  AArch32 execution states.

- Added support for Socionext UniPhier SoC platform.

- Added support for Hikey960 and Hikey platforms.

- Added support for Rockchip RK3328 platform.

- Added support for NVidia Tegra T186 platform.

- Added support for Designware emmc driver.

- Imported libfdt v1.4.2 that addresses buffer overflow in fdt_offset_ptr().

- Enhanced the CPU operations framework to allow power handlers to be registered
  on per-level basis. This enables support for future CPUs that have multiple
  threads which might need powering down individually.

- Updated register initialisation to prevent unexpected behaviour:

  - Debug registers MDCR-EL3/SDCR and MDCR_EL2/HDCR are initialised to avoid
    unexpected traps into the higher exception levels and disable secure
    self-hosted debug. Additionally, secure privileged external debug on Juno is
    disabled by programming the appropriate Juno SoC registers.
  - EL2 and EL3 configurable controls are initialised to avoid unexpected traps
    in the higher exception levels.
  - Essential control registers are fully initialised on EL3 start-up, when
    initialising the non-secure and secure context structures and when preparing
    to leave EL3 for a lower EL. This gives better alignment with the Arm ARM
    which states that software must initialise RES0 and RES1 fields with 0 / 1.

- Enhanced PSCI support:

  - Introduced new platform interfaces that decouple PSCI stat residency
    calculation from PMF, enabling platforms to use alternative methods of
    capturing timestamps.
  - PSCI stat accounting performed for retention/standby states when requested
    at multiple power levels.

- Simplified fiptool to have a single linked list of image descriptors.

- For the TSP, resolved corruption of pre-empted secure context by aborting any
  pre-empted SMC during PSCI power management requests.

### Issues resolved since last release

- TF-A can be built with the latest mbed TLS version (v2.4.2). The earlier
  version 2.3.0 cannot be used due to build warnings that the TF-A build system
  interprets as errors.
- TBBR, including the Firmware Update feature is now supported on FVP platforms
  when running TF-A in AArch32 state.
- The version of the AEMv8 Base FVP used in this release has resolved the issue
  of the model executing a reset instead of terminating in response to a
  shutdown request using the PSCI SYSTEM_OFF API.

### Known Issues

- Building TF-A with compiler optimisations disabled (-O0) fails.
- Trusted Board Boot currently does not work on Juno when running Trusted
  Firmware in AArch32 execution state due to error when loading the sp_min to
  memory because of lack of free space available. See [tf-issue#501] for more
  details.
- The errata workaround for A53 errata 843419 is only available from binutils
  2.26 and is not present in GCC4.9. If this errata is applicable to the
  platform, please use GCC compiler version of at least 5.0. See [PR#1002] for
  more details.

## 1.3 (2016-10-13)

### New features

- Added support for running TF-A in AArch32 execution state.

  The PSCI library has been refactored to allow integration with **EL3 Runtime
  Software**. This is software that is executing at the highest secure privilege
  which is EL3 in AArch64 or Secure SVC/Monitor mode in AArch32. See
  \{ref}`PSCI Library Integration guide for Armv8-A AArch32 systems`.

  Included is a minimal AArch32 Secure Payload, **SP-MIN**, that illustrates the
  usage and integration of the PSCI library with EL3 Runtime Software running in
  AArch32 state.

  Booting to the BL1/BL2 images as well as booting straight to the Secure
  Payload is supported.

- Improvements to the initialization framework for the PSCI service and Arm
  Standard Services in general.

  The PSCI service is now initialized as part of Arm Standard Service
  initialization. This consolidates the initializations of any Arm Standard
  Service that may be added in the future.

  A new function `get_arm_std_svc_args()` is introduced to get arguments
  corresponding to each standard service and must be implemented by the EL3
  Runtime Software.

  For PSCI, a new versioned structure `psci_lib_args_t` is introduced to
  initialize the PSCI Library. **Note** this is a compatibility break due to the
  change in the prototype of `psci_setup()`.

- To support AArch32 builds of BL1 and BL2, implemented a new, alternative
  firmware image loading mechanism that adds flexibility.

  The current mechanism has a hard-coded set of images and execution order
  (BL31, BL32, etc). The new mechanism is data-driven by a list of image
  descriptors provided by the platform code.

  Arm platforms have been updated to support the new loading mechanism.

  The new mechanism is enabled by a build flag (`LOAD_IMAGE_V2`) which is
  currently off by default for the AArch64 build.

  **Note** `TRUSTED_BOARD_BOOT` is currently not supported when `LOAD_IMAGE_V2`
  is enabled.

- Updated requirements for making contributions to TF-A.

  Commits now must have a 'Signed-off-by:' field to certify that the
  contribution has been made under the terms of the
  {download}`Developer Certificate of Origin <../dco.txt>`.

  A signed CLA is no longer required.

  The {ref}`Contributor's Guide` has been updated to reflect this change.

- Introduced Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) which provides support for
  capturing, storing, dumping and retrieving time-stamps to measure the
  execution time of critical paths in the firmware. This relies on defining
  fixed sample points at key places in the code.

- To support the QEMU platform port, imported libfdt v1.4.1 from
  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dtc/dtc.git>

- Updated PSCI support:

  - Added support for PSCI NODE_HW_STATE API for Arm platforms.
  - New optional platform hook, `pwr_domain_pwr_down_wfi()`, in `plat_psci_ops`
    to enable platforms to perform platform-specific actions needed to enter
    powerdown, including the 'wfi' invocation.
  - PSCI STAT residency and count functions have been added on Arm platforms by
    using PMF.

- Enhancements to the translation table library:

  - Limited memory mapping support for region overlaps to only allow regions to
    overlap that are identity mapped or have the same virtual to physical
    address offset, and overlap completely but must not cover the same area.

    This limitation will enable future enhancements without having to support
    complex edge cases that may not be necessary.

  - The initial translation lookup level is now inferred from the virtual
    address space size. Previously, it was hard-coded.

  - Added support for mapping Normal, Inner Non-cacheable, Outer Non-cacheable
    memory in the translation table library.

    This can be useful to map a non-cacheable memory region, such as a DMA
    buffer.

  - Introduced the MT_EXECUTE/MT_EXECUTE_NEVER memory mapping attributes to
    specify the access permissions for instruction execution of a memory region.

- Enabled support to isolate code and read-only data on separate memory pages,
  allowing independent access control to be applied to each.

- Enabled SCR_EL3.SIF (Secure Instruction Fetch) bit in BL1 and BL31 common
  architectural setup code, preventing fetching instructions from non-secure
  memory when in secure state.

- Enhancements to FIP support:

  - Replaced `fip_create` with `fiptool` which provides a more consistent and
    intuitive interface as well as additional support to remove an image from a
    FIP file.
  - Enabled printing the SHA256 digest with info command, allowing quick
    verification of an image within a FIP without having to extract the image
    and running sha256sum on it.
  - Added support for unpacking the contents of an existing FIP file into the
    working directory.
  - Aligned command line options for specifying images to use same naming
    convention as specified by TBBR and already used in cert_create tool.

- Refactored the TZC-400 driver to also support memory controllers that
  integrate TZC functionality, for example Arm CoreLink DMC-500. Also added
  DMC-500 specific support.

- Implemented generic delay timer based on the system generic counter and
  migrated all platforms to use it.

- Enhanced support for Arm platforms:

  - Updated image loading support to make SCP images (SCP_BL2 and SCP_BL2U)
    optional.
  - Enhanced topology description support to allow multi-cluster topology
    definitions.
  - Added interconnect abstraction layer to help platform ports select the right
    interconnect driver, CCI or CCN, for the platform.
  - Added support to allow loading BL31 in the TZC-secured DRAM instead of the
    default secure SRAM.
  - Added support to use a System Security Control (SSC) Registers Unit enabling
    TF-A to be compiled to support multiple Arm platforms and then select one at
    runtime.
  - Restricted mapping of Trusted ROM in BL1 to what is actually needed by BL1
    rather than entire Trusted ROM region.
  - Flash is now mapped as execute-never by default. This increases security by
    restricting the executable region to what is strictly needed.

- Applied following erratum workarounds for Cortex-A57: 833471, 826977, 829520,
  828024 and 826974.

- Added support for Mediatek MT6795 platform.

- Added support for QEMU virtualization Armv8-A target.

- Added support for Rockchip RK3368 and RK3399 platforms.

- Added support for Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC platform.

- Added support for Arm Cortex-A73 MPCore Processor.

- Added support for Arm Cortex-A72 processor.

- Added support for Arm Cortex-A35 processor.

- Added support for Arm Cortex-A32 MPCore Processor.

- Enabled preloaded BL33 alternative boot flow, in which BL2 does not load BL33
  from non-volatile storage and BL31 hands execution over to a preloaded BL33.
  The User Guide has been updated with an example of how to use this option with
  a bootwrapped kernel.

- Added support to build TF-A on a Windows-based host machine.

- Updated Trusted Board Boot prototype implementation:

  - Enabled the ability for a production ROM with TBBR enabled to boot test
    software before a real ROTPK is deployed (e.g. manufacturing mode). Added
    support to use ROTPK in certificate without verifying against the platform
    value when `ROTPK_NOT_DEPLOYED` bit is set.
  - Added support for non-volatile counter authentication to the Authentication
    Module to protect against roll-back.

- Updated GICv3 support:

  - Enabled processor power-down and automatic power-on using GICv3.
  - Enabled G1S or G0 interrupts to be configured independently.
  - Changed FVP default interrupt driver to be the GICv3-only driver. **Note**
    the default build of TF-A will not be able to boot Linux kernel with GICv2
    FDT blob.
  - Enabled wake-up from CPU_SUSPEND to stand-by by temporarily re-routing
    interrupts and then restoring after resume.

### Issues resolved since last release

### Known issues

- The version of the AEMv8 Base FVP used in this release resets the model
  instead of terminating its execution in response to a shutdown request using
  the PSCI `SYSTEM_OFF` API. This issue will be fixed in a future version of the
  model.
- Building TF-A with compiler optimisations disabled (`-O0`) fails.
- TF-A cannot be built with mbed TLS version v2.3.0 due to build warnings that
  the TF-A build system interprets as errors.
- TBBR is not currently supported when running TF-A in AArch32 state.

## 1.2 (2015-12-22)

### New features

- The Trusted Board Boot implementation on Arm platforms now conforms to the
  mandatory requirements of the TBBR specification.

  In particular, the boot process is now guarded by a Trusted Watchdog, which
  will reset the system in case of an authentication or loading error. On Arm
  platforms, a secure instance of Arm SP805 is used as the Trusted Watchdog.

  Also, a firmware update process has been implemented. It enables authenticated
  firmware to update firmware images from external interfaces to SoC
  Non-Volatile memories. This feature functions even when the current firmware
  in the system is corrupt or missing; it therefore may be used as a recovery
  mode.

- Improvements have been made to the Certificate Generation Tool (`cert_create`)
  as follows.

  - Added support for the Firmware Update process by extending the Chain of
    Trust definition in the tool to include the Firmware Update certificate and
    the required extensions.
  - Introduced a new API that allows one to specify command line options in the
    Chain of Trust description. This makes the declaration of the tool's
    arguments more flexible and easier to extend.
  - The tool has been reworked to follow a data driven approach, which makes it
    easier to maintain and extend.

- Extended the FIP tool (`fip_create`) to support the new set of images involved
  in the Firmware Update process.

- Various memory footprint improvements. In particular:

  - The bakery lock structure for coherent memory has been optimised.
  - The mbed TLS SHA1 functions are not needed, as SHA256 is used to generate
    the certificate signature. Therefore, they have been compiled out, reducing
    the memory footprint of BL1 and BL2 by approximately 6 KB.
  - On Arm development platforms, each BL stage now individually defines the
    number of regions that it needs to map in the MMU.

- Added the following new design documents:

  - {ref}`Authentication Framework & Chain of Trust`
  - {ref}`Firmware Update (FWU)`
  - {ref}`CPU Reset`
  - {ref}`PSCI Power Domain Tree Structure`

- Applied the new image terminology to the code base and documentation, as
  described in the {ref}`Image Terminology` document.

- The build system has been reworked to improve readability and facilitate
  adding future extensions.

- On Arm standard platforms, BL31 uses the boot console during cold boot but
  switches to the runtime console for any later logs at runtime. The TSP uses
  the runtime console for all output.

- Implemented a basic NOR flash driver for Arm platforms. It programs the device
  using CFI (Common Flash Interface) standard commands.

- Implemented support for booting EL3 payloads on Arm platforms, which reduces
  the complexity of developing EL3 baremetal code by doing essential baremetal
  initialization.

- Provided separate drivers for GICv3 and GICv2. These expect the entire
  software stack to use either GICv2 or GICv3; hybrid GIC software systems are
  no longer supported and the legacy Arm GIC driver has been deprecated.

- Added support for Juno r1 and r2. A single set of Juno TF-A binaries can run
  on Juno r0, r1 and r2 boards. Note that this TF-A version depends on a Linaro
  release that does *not* contain Juno r2 support.

- Added support for MediaTek mt8173 platform.

- Implemented a generic driver for Arm CCN IP.

- Major rework of the PSCI implementation.

  - Added framework to handle composite power states.
  - Decoupled the notions of affinity instances (which describes the
    hierarchical arrangement of cores) and of power domain topology, instead of
    assuming a one-to-one mapping.
  - Better alignment with version 1.0 of the PSCI specification.

- Added support for the SYSTEM_SUSPEND PSCI API on Arm platforms. When invoked
  on the last running core on a supported platform, this puts the system into a
  low power mode with memory retention.

- Unified the reset handling code as much as possible across BL stages. Also
  introduced some build options to enable optimization of the reset path on
  platforms that support it.

- Added a simple delay timer API, as well as an SP804 timer driver, which is
  enabled on FVP.

- Added support for NVidia Tegra T210 and T132 SoCs.

- Reorganised Arm platforms ports to greatly improve code shareability and
  facilitate the reuse of some of this code by other platforms.

- Added support for Arm Cortex-A72 processor in the CPU specific framework.

- Provided better error handling. Platform ports can now define their own error
  handling, for example to perform platform specific bookkeeping or post-error
  actions.

- Implemented a unified driver for Arm Cache Coherent Interconnects used for
  both CCI-400 & CCI-500 IPs. Arm platforms ports have been migrated to this
  common driver. The standalone CCI-400 driver has been deprecated.

### Issues resolved since last release

- The Trusted Board Boot implementation has been redesigned to provide greater
  modularity and scalability. See the
  \{ref}`Authentication Framework & Chain of Trust` document. All missing
  mandatory features are now implemented.
- The FVP and Juno ports may now use the hash of the ROTPK stored in the Trusted
  Key Storage registers to verify the ROTPK. Alternatively, a development public
  key hash embedded in the BL1 and BL2 binaries might be used instead. The
  location of the ROTPK is chosen at build-time using the `ARM_ROTPK_LOCATION`
  build option.
- GICv3 is now fully supported and stable.

### Known issues

- The version of the AEMv8 Base FVP used in this release resets the model
  instead of terminating its execution in response to a shutdown request using
  the PSCI `SYSTEM_OFF` API. This issue will be fixed in a future version of the
  model.
- While this version has low on-chip RAM requirements, there are further RAM
  usage enhancements that could be made.
- The upstream documentation could be improved for structural consistency,
  clarity and completeness. In particular, the design documentation is
  incomplete for PSCI, the TSP(D) and the Juno platform.
- Building TF-A with compiler optimisations disabled (`-O0`) fails.

## 1.1 (2015-02-04)

### New features

- A prototype implementation of Trusted Board Boot has been added. Boot loader
  images are verified by BL1 and BL2 during the cold boot path. BL1 and BL2 use
  the PolarSSL SSL library to verify certificates and images. The OpenSSL
  library is used to create the X.509 certificates. Support has been added to
  `fip_create` tool to package the certificates in a FIP.

- Support for calling CPU and platform specific reset handlers upon entry into
  BL3-1 during the cold and warm boot paths has been added. This happens after
  another Boot ROM `reset_handler()` has already run. This enables a developer
  to perform additional actions or undo actions already performed during the
  first call of the reset handlers e.g. apply additional errata workarounds.

- Support has been added to demonstrate routing of IRQs to EL3 instead of S-EL1
  when execution is in secure world.

- The PSCI implementation now conforms to version 1.0 of the PSCI specification.
  All the mandatory APIs and selected optional APIs are supported. In
  particular, support for the `PSCI_FEATURES` API has been added. A capability
  variable is constructed during initialization by examining the `plat_pm_ops`
  and `spd_pm_ops` exported by the platform and the Secure Payload Dispatcher.
  This is used by the PSCI FEATURES function to determine which PSCI APIs are
  supported by the platform.

- Improvements have been made to the PSCI code as follows.

  - The code has been refactored to remove redundant parameters from internal
    functions.
  - Changes have been made to the code for PSCI `CPU_SUSPEND`, `CPU_ON` and
    `CPU_OFF` calls to facilitate an early return to the caller in case a
    failure condition is detected. For example, a PSCI `CPU_SUSPEND` call
    returns `SUCCESS` to the caller if a pending interrupt is detected early in
    the code path.
  - Optional platform APIs have been added to validate the `power_state` and
    `entrypoint` parameters early in PSCI `CPU_ON` and `CPU_SUSPEND` code paths.
  - PSCI migrate APIs have been reworked to invoke the SPD hook to determine the
    type of Trusted OS and the CPU it is resident on (if applicable). Also,
    during a PSCI `MIGRATE` call, the SPD hook to migrate the Trusted OS is
    invoked.

- It is now possible to build TF-A without marking at least an extra page of
  memory as coherent. The build flag `USE_COHERENT_MEM` can be used to choose
  between the two implementations. This has been made possible through these
  changes.

  - An implementation of Bakery locks, where the locks are not allocated in
    coherent memory has been added.
  - Memory which was previously marked as coherent is now kept coherent through
    the use of software cache maintenance operations.

  Approximately, 4K worth of memory is saved for each boot loader stage when
  `USE_COHERENT_MEM=0`. Enabling this option increases the latencies associated
  with acquire and release of locks. It also requires changes to the platform
  ports.

- It is now possible to specify the name of the FIP at build time by defining
  the `FIP_NAME` variable.

- Issues with dependencies on the 'fiptool' makefile target have been rectified.
  The `fip_create` tool is now rebuilt whenever its source files change.

- The BL3-1 runtime console is now also used as the crash console. The crash
  console is changed to SoC UART0 (UART2) from the previous FPGA UART0 (UART0)
  on Juno. In FVP, it is changed from UART0 to UART1.

- CPU errata workarounds are applied only when the revision and part number
  match. This behaviour has been made consistent across the debug and release
  builds. The debug build additionally prints a warning if a mismatch is
  detected.

- It is now possible to issue cache maintenance operations by set/way for a
  particular level of data cache. Levels 1-3 are currently supported.

- The following improvements have been made to the FVP port.

  - The build option `FVP_SHARED_DATA_LOCATION` which allowed relocation of
    shared data into the Trusted DRAM has been deprecated. Shared data is now
    always located at the base of Trusted SRAM.
  - BL2 Translation tables have been updated to map only the region of DRAM
    which is accessible to normal world. This is the region of the 2GB DDR-DRAM
    memory at 0x80000000 excluding the top 16MB. The top 16MB is accessible to
    only the secure world.
  - BL3-2 can now reside in the top 16MB of DRAM which is accessible only to the
    secure world. This can be done by setting the build flag
    `FVP_TSP_RAM_LOCATION` to the value `dram`.

- Separate translation tables are created for each boot loader image. The
  `IMAGE_BLx` build options are used to do this. This allows each stage to
  create mappings only for areas in the memory map that it needs.

- A Secure Payload Dispatcher (OPTEED) for the OP-TEE Trusted OS has been added.
  Details of using it with TF-A can be found in {ref}`OP-TEE Dispatcher`

### Issues resolved since last release

- The Juno port has been aligned with the FVP port as follows.

  - Support for reclaiming all BL1 RW memory and BL2 memory by overlaying the
    BL3-1/BL3-2 NOBITS sections on top of them has been added to the Juno port.
  - The top 16MB of the 2GB DDR-DRAM memory at 0x80000000 is configured using
    the TZC-400 controller to be accessible only to the secure world.
  - The Arm GIC driver is used to configure the GIC-400 instead of using a GIC
    driver private to the Juno port.
  - PSCI `CPU_SUSPEND` calls that target a standby state are now supported.
  - The TZC-400 driver is used to configure the controller instead of direct
    accesses to the registers.

- The Linux kernel version referred to in the user guide has DVFS and HMP
  support enabled.

- DS-5 v5.19 did not detect Version 5.8 of the Cortex-A57-A53 Base FVPs in CADI
  server mode. This issue is not seen with DS-5 v5.20 and Version 6.2 of the
  Cortex-A57-A53 Base FVPs.

### Known issues

- The Trusted Board Boot implementation is a prototype. There are issues with
  the modularity and scalability of the design. Support for a Trusted Watchdog,
  firmware update mechanism, recovery images and Trusted debug is absent. These
  issues will be addressed in future releases.
- The FVP and Juno ports do not use the hash of the ROTPK stored in the Trusted
  Key Storage registers to verify the ROTPK in the `plat_match_rotpk()`
  function. This prevents the correct establishment of the Chain of Trust at the
  first step in the Trusted Board Boot process.
- The version of the AEMv8 Base FVP used in this release resets the model
  instead of terminating its execution in response to a shutdown request using
  the PSCI `SYSTEM_OFF` API. This issue will be fixed in a future version of the
  model.
- GICv3 support is experimental. There are known issues with GICv3
  initialization in the TF-A.
- While this version greatly reduces the on-chip RAM requirements, there are
  further RAM usage enhancements that could be made.
- The firmware design documentation for the Test Secure-EL1 Payload (TSP) and
  its dispatcher (TSPD) is incomplete. Similarly for the PSCI section.
- The Juno-specific firmware design documentation is incomplete.

## 1.0 (2014-08-28)

### New features

- It is now possible to map higher physical addresses using non-flat virtual to
  physical address mappings in the MMU setup.

- Wider use is now made of the per-CPU data cache in BL3-1 to store:

  - Pointers to the non-secure and secure security state contexts.
  - A pointer to the CPU-specific operations.
  - A pointer to PSCI specific information (for example the current power
    state).
  - A crash reporting buffer.

- The following RAM usage improvements result in a BL3-1 RAM usage reduction
  from 96KB to 56KB (for FVP with TSPD), and a total RAM usage reduction across
  all images from 208KB to 88KB, compared to the previous release.

  - Removed the separate `early_exception` vectors from BL3-1 (2KB code size
    saving).
  - Removed NSRAM from the FVP memory map, allowing the removal of one (4KB)
    translation table.
  - Eliminated the internal `psci_suspend_context` array, saving 2KB.
  - Correctly dimensioned the PSCI `aff_map_node` array, saving 1.5KB in the FVP
    port.
  - Removed calling CPU mpidr from the bakery lock API, saving 160 bytes.
  - Removed current CPU mpidr from PSCI common code, saving 160 bytes.
  - Inlined the mmio accessor functions, saving 360 bytes.
  - Fully reclaimed all BL1 RW memory and BL2 memory on the FVP port by
    overlaying the BL3-1/BL3-2 NOBITS sections on top of these at runtime.
  - Made storing the FP register context optional, saving 0.5KB per context (8KB
    on the FVP port, with TSPD enabled and running on 8 CPUs).
  - Implemented a leaner `tf_printf()` function, allowing the stack to be
    greatly reduced.
  - Removed coherent stacks from the codebase. Stacks allocated in normal memory
    are now used before and after the MMU is enabled. This saves 768 bytes per
    CPU in BL3-1.
  - Reworked the crash reporting in BL3-1 to use less stack.
  - Optimized the EL3 register state stored in the `cpu_context` structure so
    that registers that do not change during normal execution are re-initialized
    each time during cold/warm boot, rather than restored from memory. This
    saves about 1.2KB.
  - As a result of some of the above, reduced the runtime stack size in all BL
    images. For BL3-1, this saves 1KB per CPU.

- PSCI SMC handler improvements to correctly handle calls from secure states and
  from AArch32.

- CPU contexts are now initialized from the `entry_point_info`. BL3-1 fully
  determines the exception level to use for the non-trusted firmware (BL3-3)
  based on the SPSR value provided by the BL2 platform code (or otherwise
  provided to BL3-1). This allows platform code to directly run non-trusted
  firmware payloads at either EL2 or EL1 without requiring an EL2 stub or OS
  loader.

- Code refactoring improvements:

  - Refactored `fvp_config` into a common platform header.
  - Refactored the fvp gic code to be a generic driver that no longer has an
    explicit dependency on platform code.
  - Refactored the CCI-400 driver to not have dependency on platform code.
  - Simplified the IO driver so it's no longer necessary to call `io_init()` and
    moved all the IO storage framework code to one place.
  - Simplified the interface the the TZC-400 driver.
  - Clarified the platform porting interface to the TSP.
  - Reworked the TSPD setup code to support the alternate BL3-2 initialization
    flow where BL3-1 generic code hands control to BL3-2, rather than expecting
    the TSPD to hand control directly to BL3-2.
  - Considerable rework to PSCI generic code to support CPU specific operations.

- Improved console log output, by:

  - Adding the concept of debug log levels.
  - Rationalizing the existing debug messages and adding new ones.
  - Printing out the version of each BL stage at runtime.
  - Adding support for printing console output from assembler code, including
    when a crash occurs before the C runtime is initialized.

- Moved up to the latest versions of the FVPs, toolchain, EDK2, kernel, Linaro
  file system and DS-5.

- On the FVP port, made the use of the Trusted DRAM region optional at build
  time (off by default). Normal platforms will not have such a "ready-to-use"
  DRAM area so it is not a good example to use it.

- Added support for PSCI `SYSTEM_OFF` and `SYSTEM_RESET` APIs.

- Added support for CPU specific reset sequences, power down sequences and
  register dumping during crash reporting. The CPU specific reset sequences
  include support for errata workarounds.

- Merged the Juno port into the master branch. Added support for CPU hotplug and
  CPU idle. Updated the user guide to describe how to build and run on the Juno
  platform.

### Issues resolved since last release

- Removed the concept of top/bottom image loading. The image loader now
  automatically detects the position of the image inside the current memory
  layout and updates the layout to minimize fragmentation. This resolves the
  image loader limitations of previously releases. There are currently no plans
  to support dynamic image loading.
- CPU idle now works on the publicized version of the Foundation FVP.
- All known issues relating to the compiler version used have now been resolved.
  This TF-A version uses Linaro toolchain 14.07 (based on GCC 4.9).

### Known issues

- GICv3 support is experimental. The Linux kernel patches to support this are
  not widely available. There are known issues with GICv3 initialization in the
  TF-A.

- While this version greatly reduces the on-chip RAM requirements, there are
  further RAM usage enhancements that could be made.

- The firmware design documentation for the Test Secure-EL1 Payload (TSP) and
  its dispatcher (TSPD) is incomplete. Similarly for the PSCI section.

- The Juno-specific firmware design documentation is incomplete.

- Some recent enhancements to the FVP port have not yet been translated into the
  Juno port. These will be tracked via the tf-issues project.

- The Linux kernel version referred to in the user guide has DVFS and HMP
  support disabled due to some known instabilities at the time of this release.
  A future kernel version will re-enable these features.

- DS-5 v5.19 does not detect Version 5.8 of the Cortex-A57-A53 Base FVPs in CADI
  server mode. This is because the `<SimName>` reported by the FVP in this
  version has changed. For example, for the Cortex-A57x4-A53x4 Base FVP, the
  `<SimName>` reported by the FVP is `FVP_Base_Cortex_A57x4_A53x4`, while DS-5
  expects it to be `FVP_Base_A57x4_A53x4`.

  The temporary fix to this problem is to change the name of the FVP in
  `sw/debugger/configdb/Boards/ARM FVP/Base_A57x4_A53x4/cadi_config.xml`. Change
  the following line:

  ```
  <SimName>System Generator:FVP_Base_A57x4_A53x4</SimName>
  ```

  to System Generator:FVP_Base_Cortex-A57x4_A53x4

  A similar change can be made to the other Cortex-A57-A53 Base FVP variants.

## 0.4 (2014-06-03)

### New features

- Makefile improvements:

  - Improved dependency checking when building.
  - Removed `dump` target (build now always produces dump files).
  - Enabled platform ports to optionally make use of parts of the Trusted
    Firmware (e.g. BL3-1 only), rather than being forced to use all parts. Also
    made the `fip` target optional.
  - Specified the full path to source files and removed use of the `vpath`
    keyword.

- Provided translation table library code for potential re-use by platforms
  other than the FVPs.

- Moved architectural timer setup to platform-specific code.

- Added standby state support to PSCI cpu_suspend implementation.

- SRAM usage improvements:

  - Started using the `-ffunction-sections`, `-fdata-sections` and
    `--gc-sections` compiler/linker options to remove unused code and data from
    the images. Previously, all common functions were being built into all
    binary images, whether or not they were actually used.
  - Placed all assembler functions in their own section to allow more unused
    functions to be removed from images.
  - Updated BL1 and BL2 to use a single coherent stack each, rather than one per
    CPU.
  - Changed variables that were unnecessarily declared and initialized as
    non-const (i.e. in the .data section) so they are either uninitialized (zero
    init) or const.

- Moved the Test Secure-EL1 Payload (BL3-2) to execute in Trusted SRAM by
  default. The option for it to run in Trusted DRAM remains.

- Implemented a TrustZone Address Space Controller (TZC-400) driver. A default
  configuration is provided for the Base FVPs. This means the model parameter
  `-C bp.secure_memory=1` is now supported.

- Started saving the PSCI cpu_suspend 'power_state' parameter prior to
  suspending a CPU. This allows platforms that implement multiple power-down
  states at the same affinity level to identify a specific state.

- Refactored the entire codebase to reduce the amount of nesting in header files
  and to make the use of system/user includes more consistent. Also split
  platform.h to separate out the platform porting declarations from the required
  platform porting definitions and the definitions/declarations specific to the
  platform port.

- Optimized the data cache clean/invalidate operations.

- Improved the BL3-1 unhandled exception handling and reporting. Unhandled
  exceptions now result in a dump of registers to the console.

- Major rework to the handover interface between BL stages, in particular the
  interface to BL3-1. The interface now conforms to a specification and is more
  future proof.

- Added support for optionally making the BL3-1 entrypoint a reset handler
  (instead of BL1). This allows platforms with an alternative image loading
  architecture to re-use BL3-1 with fewer modifications to generic code.

- Reserved some DDR DRAM for secure use on FVP platforms to avoid future
  compatibility problems with non-secure software.

- Added support for secure interrupts targeting the Secure-EL1 Payload (SP)
  (using GICv2 routing only). Demonstrated this working by adding an interrupt
  target and supporting test code to the TSP. Also demonstrated non-secure
  interrupt handling during TSP processing.

### Issues resolved since last release

- Now support use of the model parameter `-C bp.secure_memory=1` in the Base
  FVPs (see **New features**).
- Support for secure world interrupt handling now available (see **New
  features**).
- Made enough SRAM savings (see **New features**) to enable the Test Secure-EL1
  Payload (BL3-2) to execute in Trusted SRAM by default.
- The tested filesystem used for this release (Linaro AArch64 OpenEmbedded
  14.04) now correctly reports progress in the console.
- Improved the Makefile structure to make it easier to separate out parts of the
  TF-A for re-use in platform ports. Also, improved target dependency checking.

### Known issues

- GICv3 support is experimental. The Linux kernel patches to support this are
  not widely available. There are known issues with GICv3 initialization in the
  TF-A.
- Dynamic image loading is not available yet. The current image loader
  implementation (used to load BL2 and all subsequent images) has some
  limitations. Changing BL2 or BL3-1 load addresses in certain ways can lead to
  loading errors, even if the images should theoretically fit in memory.
- TF-A still uses too much on-chip Trusted SRAM. A number of RAM usage
  enhancements have been identified to rectify this situation.
- CPU idle does not work on the advertised version of the Foundation FVP. Some
  FVP fixes are required that are not available externally at the time of
  writing. This can be worked around by disabling CPU idle in the Linux kernel.
- Various bugs in TF-A, UEFI and the Linux kernel have been observed when using
  Linaro toolchain versions later than 13.11. Although most of these have been
  fixed, some remain at the time of writing. These mainly seem to relate to a
  subtle change in the way the compiler converts between 64-bit and 32-bit
  values (e.g. during casting operations), which reveals previously hidden bugs
  in client code.
- The firmware design documentation for the Test Secure-EL1 Payload (TSP) and
  its dispatcher (TSPD) is incomplete. Similarly for the PSCI section.

## 0.3 (2014-02-28)

### New features

- Support for Foundation FVP Version 2.0 added. The documented UEFI
  configuration disables some devices that are unavailable in the Foundation
  FVP, including MMC and CLCD. The resultant UEFI binary can be used on the
  AEMv8 and Cortex-A57-A53 Base FVPs, as well as the Foundation FVP.

  \:::\{note} The software will not work on Version 1.0 of the Foundation FVP.
  \:::

- Enabled third party contributions. Added a new contributing.md containing
  instructions for how to contribute and updated copyright text in all files to
  acknowledge contributors.

- The PSCI CPU_SUSPEND API has been stabilised to the extent where it can be
  used for entry into power down states with the following restrictions:

  - Entry into standby states is not supported.
  - The API is only supported on the AEMv8 and Cortex-A57-A53 Base FVPs.

- The PSCI AFFINITY_INFO api has undergone limited testing on the Base FVPs to
  allow experimental use.

- Required C library and runtime header files are now included locally in TF-A
  instead of depending on the toolchain standard include paths. The local
  implementation has been cleaned up and reduced in scope.

- Added I/O abstraction framework, primarily to allow generic code to load
  images in a platform-independent way. The existing image loading code has been
  reworked to use the new framework. Semi-hosting and NOR flash I/O drivers are
  provided.

- Introduced Firmware Image Package (FIP) handling code and tools. A FIP
  combines multiple firmware images with a Table of Contents (ToC) into a single
  binary image. The new FIP driver is another type of I/O driver. The Makefile
  builds a FIP by default and the FVP platform code expect to load a FIP from
  NOR flash, although some support for image loading using semi- hosting is
  retained.

  \:::\{note} Building a FIP by default is a non-backwards-compatible change. :::

  \:::\{note} Generic BL2 code now loads a BL3-3 (non-trusted firmware) image
  into DRAM instead of expecting this to be pre-loaded at known location. This
  is also a non-backwards-compatible change. :::

  \:::\{note} Some non-trusted firmware (e.g. UEFI) will need to be rebuilt so
  that it knows the new location to execute from and no longer needs to copy
  particular code modules to DRAM itself. :::

- Reworked BL2 to BL3-1 handover interface. A new composite structure
  (bl31_args) holds the superset of information that needs to be passed from BL2
  to BL3-1, including information on how handover execution control to BL3-2 (if
  present) and BL3-3 (non-trusted firmware).

- Added library support for CPU context management, allowing the saving and
  restoring of

  - Shared system registers between Secure-EL1 and EL1.
  - VFP registers.
  - Essential EL3 system registers.

- Added a framework for implementing EL3 runtime services. Reworked the PSCI
  implementation to be one such runtime service.

- Reworked the exception handling logic, making use of both SP_EL0 and SP_EL3
  stack pointers for determining the type of exception, managing general purpose
  and system register context on exception entry/exit, and handling SMCs. SMCs
  are directed to the correct EL3 runtime service.

- Added support for a Test Secure-EL1 Payload (TSP) and a corresponding
  Dispatcher (TSPD), which is loaded as an EL3 runtime service. The TSPD
  implements Secure Monitor functionality such as world switching and EL1
  context management, and is responsible for communication with the TSP.

  \:::\{note} The TSPD does not yet contain support for secure world interrupts.
  \:::

  \:::\{note} The TSP/TSPD is not built by default. :::

### Issues resolved since last release

- Support has been added for switching context between secure and normal worlds
  in EL3.
- PSCI API calls `AFFINITY_INFO` & `PSCI_VERSION` have now been tested (to a
  limited extent).
- The TF-A build artifacts are now placed in the `./build` directory and
  sub-directories instead of being placed in the root of the project.
- TF-A is now free from build warnings. Build warnings are now treated as
  errors.
- TF-A now provides C library support locally within the project to maintain
  compatibility between toolchains/systems.
- The PSCI locking code has been reworked so it no longer takes locks in an
  incorrect sequence.
- The RAM-disk method of loading a Linux file-system has been confirmed to work
  with the TF-A and Linux kernel version (based on version 3.13) used in this
  release, for both Foundation and Base FVPs.

### Known issues

The following is a list of issues which are expected to be fixed in the future
releases of TF-A.

- The TrustZone Address Space Controller (TZC-400) is not being programmed yet.
  Use of model parameter `-C bp.secure_memory=1` is not supported.
- No support yet for secure world interrupt handling.
- GICv3 support is experimental. The Linux kernel patches to support this are
  not widely available. There are known issues with GICv3 initialization in
  TF-A.
- Dynamic image loading is not available yet. The current image loader
  implementation (used to load BL2 and all subsequent images) has some
  limitations. Changing BL2 or BL3-1 load addresses in certain ways can lead to
  loading errors, even if the images should theoretically fit in memory.
- TF-A uses too much on-chip Trusted SRAM. Currently the Test Secure-EL1 Payload
  (BL3-2) executes in Trusted DRAM since there is not enough SRAM. A number of
  RAM usage enhancements have been identified to rectify this situation.
- CPU idle does not work on the advertised version of the Foundation FVP. Some
  FVP fixes are required that are not available externally at the time of
  writing.
- Various bugs in TF-A, UEFI and the Linux kernel have been observed when using
  Linaro toolchain versions later than 13.11. Although most of these have been
  fixed, some remain at the time of writing. These mainly seem to relate to a
  subtle change in the way the compiler converts between 64-bit and 32-bit
  values (e.g. during casting operations), which reveals previously hidden bugs
  in client code.
- The tested filesystem used for this release (Linaro AArch64 OpenEmbedded
  14.01) does not report progress correctly in the console. It only seems to
  produce error output, not standard output. It otherwise appears to function
  correctly. Other filesystem versions on the same software stack do not exhibit
  the problem.
- The Makefile structure doesn't make it easy to separate out parts of the TF-A
  for re-use in platform ports, for example if only BL3-1 is required in a
  platform port. Also, dependency checking in the Makefile is flawed.
- The firmware design documentation for the Test Secure-EL1 Payload (TSP) and
  its dispatcher (TSPD) is incomplete. Similarly for the PSCI section.

## 0.2 (2013-10-25)

### New features

- First source release.
- Code for the PSCI suspend feature is supplied, although this is not enabled by
  default since there are known issues (see below).

### Issues resolved since last release

- The "psci" nodes in the FDTs provided in this release now fully comply with
  the recommendations made in the PSCI specification.

### Known issues

The following is a list of issues which are expected to be fixed in the future
releases of TF-A.

- The TrustZone Address Space Controller (TZC-400) is not being programmed yet.
  Use of model parameter `-C bp.secure_memory=1` is not supported.
- No support yet for secure world interrupt handling or for switching context
  between secure and normal worlds in EL3.
- GICv3 support is experimental. The Linux kernel patches to support this are
  not widely available. There are known issues with GICv3 initialization in
  TF-A.
- Dynamic image loading is not available yet. The current image loader
  implementation (used to load BL2 and all subsequent images) has some
  limitations. Changing BL2 or BL3-1 load addresses in certain ways can lead to
  loading errors, even if the images should theoretically fit in memory.
- Although support for PSCI `CPU_SUSPEND` is present, it is not yet stable and
  ready for use.
- PSCI API calls `AFFINITY_INFO` & `PSCI_VERSION` are implemented but have not
  been tested.
- The TF-A make files result in all build artifacts being placed in the root of
  the project. These should be placed in appropriate sub-directories.
- The compilation of TF-A is not free from compilation warnings. Some of these
  warnings have not been investigated yet so they could mask real bugs.
- TF-A currently uses toolchain/system include files like stdio.h. It should
  provide versions of these within the project to maintain compatibility between
  toolchains/systems.
- The PSCI code takes some locks in an incorrect sequence. This may cause
  problems with suspend and hotplug in certain conditions.
- The Linux kernel used in this release is based on version 3.12-rc4. Using this
  kernel with the TF-A fails to start the file-system as a RAM-disk. It fails to
  execute user-space `init` from the RAM-disk. As an alternative, the
  VirtioBlock mechanism can be used to provide a file-system to the kernel.
